	"description": "SAMURAI is a legendary chromatic rock band featured throughout the Cyberpunk series, for whom music was a way to rebel against corporations. They are featured in Cyberpunk 2077, where they are musically portrayed by the real-life punk band Refused. \n\nDespite the band being named Samurai, the logo is actually an \"Oni\" which is a kind of y≈çkai that appears in Japanese folklore. The Oni mask that would cover someone's face fully was not as popular with samurais as the menpo which covered the lower half of the face.",
